  <h2>HTML has been around for a loooonngg time. You know the www. that comes up before a link?
    Thats actually a reference to the World Wide Web, which was made with only HTML, and was also the first website ever created.
    Its basically the great ancestor of the Wikipedia.
    Then, a few years later, apparentely HTML wasnt pretty enough, so they came up with CSS.
    CSS is just there to make your website look good.</h2>
